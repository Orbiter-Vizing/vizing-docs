# NFT-Wrapper

## 01 / Overview

NFT-Wrapper is a cross-chain solution for NFTs. The solution utilizes the Vizing to empower NFTs with cross-chain capabilities and allows seamless integration of standard NFT projects without modifying the NFT protocol. Through NFT-Wrapper, users can transfer NFT assets across different chains while retaining the ability to transfer NFTs between accounts.

### Global NFT Identifier (gTokenId)

NFT-Wrapper employs a global NFT identifier (gTokenId) to uniquely identify cross-chain transferred NFT assets. The gTokenId is computed by hashing the source network ID, NFT project address, and NFT ID, ensuring its global uniqueness. This globally unique identifier enables NFT assets to be transferred across multiple chains where NFT-Wrapper is deployed.

### NFT-Wrapper Contract Interaction Logic

The NFT-Wrapper contract supports the following four interaction logic:

1. **wrapNFT**: Users transfer their original NFT assets to the NFT-Wrapper contract and receive a wrapped NFT (WNFT) in return. This process locks the NFT asset within the NFT-Wrapper contract and assigns it a globally unique gTokenId.
2. **un-wrapNFT**: Users can call the `un-wrapNFT` method of the NFT-Wrapper contract to unwrap the WNFT and retrieve the original NFT asset. This allows users to reclaim their unwrapped NFT.
3. **mintNFT**: On the target chain, the `mintNFT` method is invoked using the Vizing algorithm to mint the NFT asset on that chain. This process generates a globally unique gTokenId using the source network ID, NFT project address, and NFT ID, and mints the NFT asset on the target chain.
4. **burnNFT**: When users want to transfer NFT assets from the source chain to the target chain, they can invoke the `burnNFT` method. This process involves burning the WNFT on the source chain and then calling the `mintNFT` method using the Vizing algorithm to mint the NFT asset on the target chain. Through this step, the NFT asset becomes available on the target chain.

## 03 / Advantages of NFT-Wrapper

The NFT-Wrapper solution offers the following advantages:

- **Integration with Standard NFT Projects**: NFT-Wrapper allows direct integration of standard NFT projects without requiring modifications to the NFT protocol. This provides convenience for existing NFT projects to leverage the cross-chain functionality of NFT-Wrapper.
- **Global Uniqueness Identifier**: By utilizing the global NFT identifier (gTokenId), NFT-Wrapper achieves global uniqueness for NFT assets across multiple chains. This ensures the uniqueness and consistency of cross-chain transferred NFT assets on different chains.
- **Cross-Account Transfer**: Even after cross-chain transfers, NFT assets remain transferable across accounts. This enables users to freely transfer and trade NFT assets on different chains.
